 * tinflate.c -- tiny inflate library
 * http://achurch.org/tinflate.c
 *
 * Written by Andrew Church <achurch@achurch.org>
 * This source code is public domain.
 *
 * ==============================================
 *
 * Version history:
 *
 * Version 1.7, 2017-06-04
 *   - Fixed two cases in which the Microsoft Visual Studio C compiler
 *     reported a signed/unsigned comparison mismatch due to integer
 *     promotions (from unsigned short to signed int).
 *
 * Version 1.6, 2016-02-18
 *   - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect output on systems with a 16-bit
 *     "int" type.  Thanks to Martijn Schipper for reporting the bug.
 *   - Fixed a slightly inaccurate comment.
 *
 * Version 1.5b, 2013-01-21
 *   - Style tweaks; no functional changes.
 *
 * Version 1.5a, 2012-03-16
 *   - Removed checks on function parameters which can be proven to always
 *     pass, instead documenting them as function preconditions; no
 *     functional changes.
 *   - As of this version, tinflate.c has been tested to 100% line and
 *     branch coverage, as reported by GCC's gcov tool (adjusted for an
 *     apparent failure to record data for certain return-to-branch cases).
 *
 * Version 1.5, 2011-12-04
 *   - Fixed failure to detect an RFC 1950 header in tinflate_partial()
 *     if the data was fed in one byte at a time.
 *   - Improved robustness against invalid Huffman table data.
 *   - Removed some redundant value checks.
 *   - Changed some "int" fields in the state block to "char" to reduce
 *     the structure size.
 *   - Fixed incompatibilities with the ANSI C (C89) standard.
 *   - Cleaned up some comments.
 *
 * Version 1.4a, 2010-11-03
 *   - Fixed warnings from GCC about comparisons between signed and
 *     unsigned values; no functional changes.
 *
 * Version 1.4, 2010-08-21
 *   - Fixed a decompression bug which would cause a crash or memory
 *     corruption when a repeated string was encountered after the output
 *     buffer size had been exceeded.  (This error did not occur when the
 *     output buffer was large enough for the decompressed data.)
 *   - Made tinflate_block() slightly more robust against a corrupted
 *     state block.
 *   - Renamed the INVALID state to INITIAL for clarity.
 *   - Changed C++-style comments to C-style for maximum compiler
 *     compatibility.
 *   - Cleaned up some comments.
 *
 * Version 1.3a, 2010-03-26
 *   - Minor comment clarifications and whitespace cleanup; no functional
 *     changes.
 *
 * Version 1.3, 2009-04-12
 *   - Fixed bugs in computing the CRC of decompressed data on systems
 *     where the "long" type is more than 32 bits wide (e.g. x86-64).
 *     The decompressed data itself is unaffected by the bug.
 *
 * Version 1.2, 2008-05-03
 *   - Fixed a bug in which tinflate() and tinflate_partial() could treat
 *     a non-final block as final if it ended on the last byte of input
 *     data.
 *   - Fixed a bug in which a dynamic Huffman table containing no symbols
 *     (a dynamic-table block with only literal codes) would cause a
 *     decompression error.
 *   - Added support for compiler-specific branch hinting (such support
 *     must be enabled externally).
 *   - Performed various minor optimizations.
 *
 * Version 1.1, 2007-08-31
 *   - Added tinflate_partial() and tinflate_state_size().
 *
 * Version 1.0, 2007-07-22
 *   - Initial release.
 *
 * ==============================================
 *
 * This file implements a simple, portable decompressor for the "deflate"
 * compression algorithm, as specified in RFC 1951.  The decompressor is
 * designed to be both independent of external libraries and as compact as
 * possible: it uses only around 2k of stack space (on the Intel x86
 * platform; other platforms may differ), and it does not require dynamic
 * memory management functions such as malloc() to be available.  Because
 * of this emphasis on size, however, the decompressor is not as fast as
 * other implementations, such as that in the "zlib" library.
 *
 * To decompress a stream of data compressed with the "deflate" algorithm,
 * call:
 *     tinflate(compressed_data, compressed_size,
 *              output_buffer, output_size,
 *              &crc_ret)
 * where:
 *     - "compressed_data" is a pointer to the first byte of the compressed
 *          data;
 *     - "compressed_size" is the number of bytes of compressed data;
 *     - "output_buffer" is a pointer to the first byte of the buffer into
 *          which the decompressed data will be stored;
 *     - "output_size" is the number of bytes available in the output
 *          buffer; and
 *     - "crc_ret" is a pointer to a variable which will receive the CRC-32
 *          of the decompressed data, or NULL if the CRC is not needed.
 *
 * The tinflate() function returns the number of bytes occupied by the
 * decompressed data (a nonnegative value), or an unspecified negative
 * number if the data cannot be decompressed.  Note that a too-small output
 * buffer is _not_ considered an error; the buffer will be filled with
 * decompressed data up to the number of bytes specified by "output_size",
 * and the function will return the number of bytes that would have been
 * stored given a buffer of infinite size.  (Thus, the decompressed size of
 * the data can be obtained by passing NULL for "output_buffer" and zero
 * for "output_size", though this incurs the computational expense of
 * actually decompressing the data once.)
 *
 * The tinflate() function automatically detects and skips past the 2-byte
 * header added by the "zlib" library's deflate() function, as defined in
 * RFC 1950.  However, preset dictionaries are not supported, and
 * tinflate() will return an error if the zlib header indicates that the
 * stream requires a preset dictionary.
 *
 * For cases where the compressed data is not available in its entirety,
 * the tinflate_partial() routine can be used instead to decompress the
 * stream one part at a time.  Call:
 *     tinflate_partial(compressed_data, compressed_size,
 *                      output_buffer, output_size,
 *                      &size_ret, &crc_ret,
 *                      state_buffer, state_buffer_size)
 * where "state_buffer" is a pointer to a region of memory which will be
 * used to store decompression state information, and "state_buffer_size"
 * is the size in bytes of the region.  The buffer must be zeroed before
 * the first tinflate_partial() call for a particular stream of data, and
 * it must not be changed between calls.  The required size of the region
 * in bytes can be obtained by calling the tinflate_state_size() function:
 *     int state_buffer_size = tinflate_state_size();
 *
 * tinflate_partial() will return zero (not the uncompressed data size) on
 * success, or a negative value on error.  If all input data is consumed
 * before the end of the compressed stream is reached, tinflate_partial()
 * will return a positive value; the function should then be called again,
 * passing the next block of input data in "compressed_data".  The total
 * size of the uncompressed data will be stored in the variable pointed to
 * by "size_ret" (if not NULL) when the end of the compressed stream is
 * reached.
 *
 * After tinflate_partial() returns, all data pointed to by
 * "compressed_data" will have been consumed, and the caller may freely
 * dispose of it.  The output buffer may also be freely moved and resized
 * between calls; however, any data discarded due to a full output buffer
 * cannot be recovered by resizing the output buffer after the fact (the
 * decompression must be restarted from the beginning to recover the lost
 * data).
