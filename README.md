- WARNING! -

The ROM this repository builds while has a matching checksum cannot be 'shifted' due
to hardcoded pointers which have yet to be dumped. Thus this repository is currently
in an experimental and research phase and cannot currently be used traditionally as a
source code base for general changes.
```

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the ROM. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the required assets.
